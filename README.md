# Repreact

Based on @chenglou's React experiments.

Preact bindings for Reason. So far only `h` works though. Really there isn't much
I guess this should serve more as an example of how to do it, rather than a
library itself.

You can take this as a template! Bring your own webpack though. Do your coding
in `src/` and the final JS files can be found in `dist/` after running
`npm run build`.
